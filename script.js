//TODO: 1. create a webpage with 16 x 16 grid of square divs
// => create div using JavaScript (using createElement and add class name "container")
// => create another div using JavaScript(using createElement and add class name "grid")
// => attach the grid div inside the container div
// => using Css and create Grid in HTML file(I think flexbox or CSS Grid is suitable for job)
// => Perhaps, grid width and height should be decided in advance

//TODO: 2. create hover effect
// => I think mouse enter or mouse leave or mouse over event is useful (But, it needs google)
// => if mouse hover in grid, grid have to change color. So, background of the grid change

// TODO: 3. create Grid button
// => On page top, create button. When button click, popup shows and asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid.
// => Existing grid should reset (or removed) and create new grid
// => Grid number should be decided in advance (ex. max 100 x 100)

// TODO: Extra
// => Instead of just changing the color of a square from black to white (for example), have each pass through with the mouse change it to a completely random RGB value.
